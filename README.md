# Zhengqi Chen – Research Projects in Applied Economics

This repository presents a curated portfolio of applied economics research conducted during my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto. Each project reflects hands-on experience with empirical analysis, economic modeling, and econometrics, developed under the supervision of leading faculty in Industrial Organization, Macroeconomics, and Financial Economics.

## 📊 ECO418 – Empirical Industrial Organization  
**Supervisor:** Professor Yao Luo  
**Project:** *Consumer Demand, Heterogeneity, and Welfare in the Diabetes Prescription Drug Market*

- Linked MEPS prescription and patient datasets via patient IDs.
- Estimated demand using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** and a **Multinomial Logit Model** to uncover individual preferences and utility functions.
- Applied the **BLP IV estimation** method to address endogeneity and analyze cost-related decisions in firm behavior.
- Assessed **consumer welfare** and choice patterns, with a focus on diabetes drug accessibility.

## 📈 ECO451 – Macroeconomics Growth  
**Supervisor:** Professor Diego Restuccia  
**Project:** *The Analysis of Misallocation Across Provinces in Canada*

- Constructed a **Cobb-Douglas production framework** with **province-specific productivity** inputs.
- Compiled provincial panel data (2015–2023) from Statistics Canada: GDP, capital stock, labor force, and wages.
- Measured **TFPR** and **Distortion Wedges (τ)** to quantify misallocation.
- Found that correcting inefficiencies could raise annual TFP by up to **3.3%**.

## 📉 ECO375 – Applied Econometrics  
**Supervisor:** Professor Courtney Ward  
**Project:** *Market Capitalization and Growth Determinants in Canadian Firms*

- Built a panel dataset of **449 publicly traded Canadian firms (2016–2023)** from the Bloomberg Terminal.
- Used multiple regression models to study how firm size influences revenue growth.
- Controlled for liquidity, leverage, profitability, R&D, and **time-fixed effects**.
- Detected statistically significant negative correlation between market size and growth, supporting theories of diminishing returns for larger firms.
